# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction (Python)

This project demonstrates how to analyze customer churn and predict churners using machine learning in Python. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, the goal is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive steps to improve retention.

## Overview

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service. Predicting churn is essential for reducing revenue loss and maintaining a loyal customer base. This project builds a classification model to distinguish between churned and retained customers.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   The dataset includes features like tenure, InternetService, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, and the target variable Churn.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare data for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze churn distribution and feature relationships to understand the data better.

4. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Visualization & Insights**  
   Use feature importance and ROC curves to interpret model results and identify key churn drivers.
